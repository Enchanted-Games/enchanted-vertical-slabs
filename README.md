# Enchanted Vertical Slabs v2
A rewrite of the original [Enchanted Vertical Slabs](https://github.com/Enchanted-Games/vertical-slabs) mod to support both Fabric and NeoForge
Originally forked from [jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template)

## Mod Features
Most of the mods features:

### Vertical Slabs variants of all vanilla slabs
For now, the mod only adds vertical slabs for all vanilla slabs

### Crafing
Vertical slabs are crafted in a crafting table the same way as vanilla slabs but vertically.
Some stone vertical slabs can also be crafted in a Stonecutter

### Placing
To place a vertical slab, you need to craft one, this mod uses a seperate item for vertical slabs. You can combine vertical slabs in the same way vanilla slabs can be combined

### Other
- Vertical slabs can now be used as furnace fuel
- Wooden Vertical slabs are flammable, be careful with fire!
- Copper vertical slabs can be waxed and oxidise, just like other copper blocks
